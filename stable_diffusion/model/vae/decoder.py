# Autoencoder for [Stable Diffusion](../index.html)

This implements the auto-encoder model used to map between image space and latent space.

We have kept to the model definition and naming unchanged from
[CompVis/stable-diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion)
so that we can load the checkpoints directly.
